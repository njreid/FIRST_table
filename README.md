# FIRST Lego Robot League Table

This is a work-in-progress design for a new approach to building the standard competition table used in the FIRST lego league.

## Approach

The design uses one 120"x60" 6mm Sintra Vers panel - a PVC foam board which is both light and stiff.

## Key Benefits

- At <40lb, these are much lighter than traditional plywood+lumber tables (often more than 120lb)
- Sintra is relatively affordable (~$100/sheet)
- Sintra comes pre-painted in a standard matte black color - no painting required!
- Can be quickly assembled using PVC cement or other PVC-appropriate adhesives.
